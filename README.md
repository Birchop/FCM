# FCM  
The 2nd arduino project I took on needed a controller to fire off a spark generator and control gas flow.  
The result was a mostly working piece of code based laregely around if statements.  
This is a personal reminder of the progress I am making while learning rather than a repo to be used, since it probably belongs on r/ProgrammingHorror.  
Please, go find a better example to achieve what you're trying to do. This ain't it, chief.
